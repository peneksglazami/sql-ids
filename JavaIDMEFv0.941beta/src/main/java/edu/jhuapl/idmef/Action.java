/**
 * <pre>
 * The Action class is used to describe any actions taken by the
 * analyzer in response to the event.  Is is represented in the XML DTD
 * as follows:
 * 
 *    &lt!ENTITY % attvals.actioncat            "
 *        ( block-installed | notification-sent | taken-offline |
 *          other )
 *    "&gt
 *    &lt!ELEMENT Action     (#PCDATA | EMPTY)* &gt
 *    &lt!ATTLIST Action
 *        category            %attvals.actioncat;     'other'
 *    &gt
 * 
 * Action has one attribute:
 * 
 * category
 *  The type of action taken.  The permitted values are shown below.
 *  The default value is "other."
 *
 *    Rank   Keyword            Description
 *    ----   -------            -----------
 *     0    BLOCK_INSTALLED    A block of some sort was installed to
 *                             prevent an attack from reaching its
 *                             destination.  The block could be a port
 *                             block, address block, etc., or disabling
 *                             a user account.
 *     1    NOTIFICATION_SENT  A notification message of some sort was
 *                             sent out-of-band (via pager, e-mail,
 *                             etc.).  Does not include the
 *                             transmission of this alert.
 *     2    TAKEN_OFFLINE      A system, computer, or user was taken
 *                             offline, as when the computer is shut
 *          OTHER              Anything not in one of the above
 *                             categories.
 *
 * The element itself may be empty, or may contain a textual description
 * of the action, if the analyzer is able to provide additional details.
