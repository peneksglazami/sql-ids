/**
 * <pre>
 * The Impact class is used to provide the analyzer's assessment of the
 * impact of the event on the target(s).  It is represented in the XML
 *  DTD as follows:
 *
 *     &lt!ENTITY % attvals.severity             "
 *         ( low | medium | high )
 *     "&gt
 *     &lt!ENTITY % attvals.completion           "
 *         ( failed | succeeded )
 *     "&gt
 *     &lt!ENTITY % attvals.impacttype           "
 *         ( admin | dos | file | recon | user | other )
 *     "&gt
 *     &lt!ELEMENT Impact     (#PCDATA | EMPTY)* &gt
 *     &lt!ATTLIST Impact
 *         severity            %attvals.severity;      #IMPLIED
 *         completion          %attvals.completion;    #IMPLIED
 *         type                %attvals.impacttype;    'other'
 *     &gt
 *
 * The Impact class has three attributes:
 *
 * severity
 *    An estimate of the relative severity of the event.  The permitted
 *    values are shown below.  There is no default value.
 *
 *    Rank   Keyword            Description
 *    ----   -------            -----------
 *      0    low                Low severity
 *      1    medium             Medium severity
 *      2    high               High severity
 *
 * completion
 *    An indication of whether the analyzer believes the attempt that
 *    the event describes was successful or not.  The permitted values
 *    are shown below.  There is no default value.
 *
 *    Rank   Keyword            Description
 *    ----   -------            -----------
 *      0    failed             The attempt was not successful
 *      1    succeeded          The attempt succeeded
 *
 * type
 *    The type of attempt represented by this event, in relatively broad
 *    categories.  The permitted values are shown below.  The default
 *    value is "other."
 * 
 *    Rank   Keyword            Description
 *    ----   -------            -----------
 *      0    admin              Administrative privileges were
 *                              attempted or obtained
 *      1    dos                A denial of service was attempted or
 *                              completed
 *      2    file               An action on a file was attempted or
 *                              completed
 *      3    recon              A reconnaissance probe was attempted
 *                              or completed
 *      4    user               User privileges were attempted or
 *                              obtained
 *      5    other              Anything not in one of the above
 *                              categories
 *
 * All three attributes are optional.  The element itself may be empty,
 * or may contain a textual description of the impact, if the analyzer
 * is able to provide additional details.
