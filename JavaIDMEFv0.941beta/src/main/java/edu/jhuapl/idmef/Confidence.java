/**
 * <pre>
 * The Confidence class is used to represent the analyzer's best
 * estimate of the validity of its analysis.  It is represented in the
 * XML DTD as follows:
 * 
 *     &lt!ENTITY % attvals.rating               "
 *         ( low | medium | high | numeric )
 *     "&gt
 *     &lt!ELEMENT Confidence (#PCDATA | EMPTY)* &gt
 *     &lt!ATTLIST Confidence
 *         rating              %attvals.rating;        'numeric'
 *     &gt
 *
 *  The Confidence class has one attribute:
 *
 *  rating
 *     The analyzer's rating of its analytical validity.  The permitted
 *     values are shown below.  The default value is "numeric."
 *
 *     Rank   Keyword            Description
 *     ----   -------            -----------
 *       0    LOW                The analyzer has little confidence in
 *                               its validity
 *       1    MEDIUM             The analyzer has average confidence in
 *                               its validity
 *       2    HIGH               The analyzer has high confidence in its
 *                               validity
 *       3    NUMERIC            The analyzer has provided a posterior
 *                               probability value indicating its
 *                               confidence in its validity
 *
 *  This element should be used only when the analyzer can produce
 *  meaningful information.  Systems that can output only a rough
 *  heuristic should use "low", "medium", or "high" as the rating value.
 *  In this case, the element content should be omitted.
 *
 *  Systems capable of producing reasonable probability estimates should
 *  use "numeric" as the rating value and include a numeric confidence
 *  value in the element content. This numeric value should reflect a
 *  posterior probability (the probability that an attack has occurred
 *  given the data seen by the detection system and the model used by the
 *  system). It is a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0,
 *  inclusive. The number of digits should be limited to those
 *  representable by a single precision floating point value, and may be
 *  represented as described in Section 4.4.2.
 * <b>
 *  NOTE: It should be noted that different types of analyzers may
 *        compute confidence values in different ways and that in many
 *        cases, confidence values from different analyzers should not be
 *        compared (for example, if the analyzers use different methods
 *        of computing or representing confidence, or are of different
 *        types or configurations).  Care should be taken when
 *        implementing systems that process confidence values (such as
 *        event correlators) not to make comparisons or assumptions that
 *        cannot be supported by the system's knowledge of the
 *        environment in which it is working.
